# Astro Lab Final Project: Star-forming Regions in Merging Galaxies
This data and this notebook was created in completion of the fifth and final project in an Upper Division / Graduate Level Astronomy lab course at UT Austin during the Spring 2020 semester. This project was the most advanced in terms of the data analysis skills required, as well as the most challenging in terms of the level of independent and original thought required. This project was carried through from the inception and proposal write-up to observation (done solo using the 30 inch diameter telescope at McDonald Observatory) and data analysis by yours truly. The idea of the project was to observe several different galaxies in different stages of merging with other galaxies and to track how star formation rates evolve over the course of the merging event. Unfortunately I no longer have the project report but I have included the proposal that I wrote to the telescope Time Allocation Committee (TAC). The success of this project was hampered when it was revealed, after I had already made observations, that the H-alpha filter, neccessary for detecting star forming regions in a galaxy, had been mislabeled and in fact was not present in the telescope at the time of observation.
